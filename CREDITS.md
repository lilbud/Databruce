## An incomplete list of credits
### Listing where I sourced data from

#### People:
- mgravitt2 (GreasyLake forum) - release dates of 2014, 2016-17, 2023 official live downloads. Dates are approximate and are within a day or two of the actual release date. Date listed is when he downloaded them.
- mjk5510 - runs the "Multiple Recorder Project". Which tracks all the various audience tape versions of shows that are circulating. Originally I had a version of the list from 2014, and added that info into the database. I attempted to find an updated version with no luck, eventually messaged mjk5510 on DIME and asked about a new copy of the list. Bit later I received a new copy of the project spreadsheet from January 2024, with it being as up to date as it can be. In that time (10 years!), the list went from 82 shows/194 recorders to 237 shows/601 recorders. Most of which I was able to find a match for in the springsteenlyrics dataset. With an additional 72 recorders being added manually.

#### Sources
- Brucebase - the main source of the data concerning bruces live shows, although data was heavily modified after the fact to fit database.
- Springsteenlyrics - list of bootlegs was from this site, initial list was gotten from here. I proceeded to *heavily* modify list to match database. Including various date correction, as well as info correction like fixing titles and whatnot. This part has taken the longest, mainly because their data is not entirely complete. Some bootlegs have incorrect dates, others have no info at all, some have info but only in the provided file whereas the page says "no title" or having no version info.
- Musicbrainz - whenever a bootleg was a retail release, I attempted to link the musicbrainz id.
- SpringsteenDVDs - run by otacon. Similar to springsteenlyrics but focuses entirely on bootleg DVDs. Data was in a slightly better place but still slightly incomplete, had to be fixed to link to proper dates. Added another 300 or so bootlegs to the database.


Between SDVDs, mjk5510's project, and springsteenlyrics, the total count is around 5k bootlegs. Originally around 6.5k boots, but I trimmed it down. Made sure that all unique releases were listed, and duplicates of the same boot weren't. Removing stuff like duplicate vinyl pressings of the same bootleg, as some would have 7 or 8 different vinyl variants. Which for the most part isn't super relevant to those downloading bootlegs digitally. Who would usually only end up with one vinyl rip, provided that there are no better sources (which there are in most cases.)
